## Project Status

## Features

- Dependency resolution for Kubernetes deployments
- Swap dependency implementations on the go
- Transparent and extensible

## FAQ

### What's a vedette?

This project helps you to find and swap alternative implementations of your dependencies, so I was looking for a name that has something to do with scouting.
As it's a Kubernetes project, it obviously needed a nautical name.

So one CTRL+F in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_nautical_terms later, I chose the first term with a free .io domain: `vedette.io`

> vedette  
> (or vedette boat)  
> A small naval patrol boat used for scouting enemy forces.

### Where is the code?

**super** early development -> no code yet...

That's also why it's not production ready.

But don't worry!

(WIP, please be kind)
